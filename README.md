# About the game
The game is based on skill of the player and it is very difficult to play for someone who never player hard-games, but after understanding the mechanics it will be more easily to do it.
You will start in the beginning with 3 lives, rappresented by 3 eggs, and every time you eat a banana, a sound effect will be played and you will lose 1.
When you will all the lives, you will have lost and a Game Over will be displayed.
You can restart with the same name or you can change it after you will press exit instead of pressing on the pig (Insert Coin Pig)
The goal of the game is to do a better high score every time, trying to dodge and avoid all the bananas (because he doesn't like them).
